# Defenders of Deshmel

## A turn-based strategy game

Darkness has overrun Deshmel, leaving your band of spellcasters and warriors to take back the land. 
In this application, players control a group of heroes by taking actions on their turn, to slay enemies
on the board. The application will load a board and indicate the **location of the players** and enemies.
It will also control the **movement of the enemies** and keep **track of health levels** of all characters.
The application will display the rules to the players when they trigger the **help function**, and display a character's
stats when they call the help function on that character. Players can see the number of enemies remaining and the
number of good characters remaining through asking for a **stats display**. Later functionality will include multiple 
game board shapes and wall formations, as well as varying amounts of enemies based on whether easy, medium or hard mode 
is selected.

###This application will be used by:###
- People who like to play board games in digital format
- Audience ages 10 - 25
- Solo players
- Collaborative game players as a team

###My interest:###
This project is interesting to me because I love strategy based board games, and have always wanted to be able to create
my own game. Additionally, it allows for a very simple beginning implementation that has a large amount of opportunity 
for expansion of bonus features such as AI, character customization or action feedback, allowing the creation of a
base feature set that can be continuously expanded or delivered in that state. This expansion capability is really 
exciting for me because I can play and enjoy the game as I go, while making it even better in each iteration.

##User Stories##

As a user I want to be able to:
- move my character around on the board, but not through walls
- add a new character to the board, and have enemies be added to the board
- attack an enemy with my character's weapon
- display the help and stats views
- see what special abilities the character I'm currently controlling has
- remove a character when their Hit Points drop below 0
