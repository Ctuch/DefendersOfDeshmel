Welcome to Defenders of Deshmel!

You control the players - a bank of characters that you can add to the board, move around, and attack enemies with.

In this simple turn based application, you take an action and the enemies will retaliate.

To Win: Defeat all of the enemies before they defeat you.

On your turn you can do on of the following actions for free:

   h -> help menu
        Display this window at any time to view the rules.
   d -> display character stats
        Take this action at any time to learn about any character. Here you can view their attack power, weapon range,
        health remaining, and remaining charges of special actions
   q -> quit
        Take this action to end the game early

Or one of these actions that consumes your turn action:
    a -> add character
         Add a character from your character bank if there are any remaining
    m -> move character
         Move a character who is already on the board to an adjacent square, horizontally or vertically
    x -> attack
         Attack any enemy in range of your weapon, vertically or horizontally

To end the game, take the quit action.

In the console version of the game, the board displays as a series of - , | , and # symbols. You can pass through - and
|, but not through # which represent walls.

Special actions:
    - Fire Sorceress: Deal 3 damage to all enemies on the board
    - Ice Sorcerer: Reduces the attack power of all enemies by 1
